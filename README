A viewer for the famous Mandelbrot set which allows viewing of the coresponding
Julia set via double clicking on the mandelbrot set. Panning, zooming, and
resizing of the window are all supported. Currently each viewer takes up half
the screen width and cannot be resized.

Written in wxWidgets for cross compatibility (Linux, Windows, and likely macOS
are supported). The proper libraries for Windows need to be found by the
person compiling. The script labeled for Windows is only designed for my
machine.
